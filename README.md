## Creating a Tiny Data Set
A "tiny" data set is essentially a simplified version of your full data set, designed to test specific functionalities of your model without the overhead of large-scale data. This is particularly useful for verifying the logic of your model incrementally.

## Steps to Create a Tiny Data Set:

### Identify Key Components: 
Determine which operations (Make, Buy, Ship) and resources are essential for your initial tests.
### Reduce Scale: 
Limit the number of operations and time periods. For example, use only 1-2 operations and 1-2 time periods.
### Simplify Parameters: 
- Set costs, times, and material usages to easily trackable numbers (e.g., integers like 1, 2, 10).
- Minimize the number of resources and materials involved in the test cases.
### Define Minimal Sets and Parameters:
