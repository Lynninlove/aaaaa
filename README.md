## Analysis of Factors Affecting Antelope Fawns Birth

### (a) Response Variable
The response variable in this study is **"fawns"**.

### (b) Multiple Linear Regression Model

#### (i) Values of \( k \) and \( n \)
- \( k \): The number of explanatory variables (adults, rainfall, winter) is 3.
- \( n \): The number of observations is 8.

#### (ii) Vectorized Form of the Model
The regression model can be expressed in a vectorized form as:
\[ \mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{X}\beta + \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \]
Where:
- \( \mathbf{Y} \) is the \( 8 \times 1 \) vector of the dependent variable (fawns).
- \( \mathbf{X} \) is the \( 8 \times 4 \) matrix of independent variables including a column of ones for the intercept.
- \( \beta \) is the \( 4 \times 1 \) vector of coefficients \( [\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3] \).
- \( \boldsymbol{\epsilon} \) is the \( 8 \times 1 \) vector of errors, assumed NID(0, \( \sigma^2 \)).

### (c) ANOVA and Linear Model Analysis

#### (i) Coefficients and \( \sigma^2 \)
- Intercept (\( \beta_0 \)) = -5.92201
- Adults (\( \beta_1 \)) = 0.33822
- Rainfall (\( \beta_2 \)) = 0.40150
- Winter (\( \beta_3 \)) = 0.26295
- \( \sigma^2 \) (Residual standard error squared): \( 0.1209^2 \)

#### (ii) Multiple R-squared Calculation
\[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}} \]

#### (iii) F-value and Distribution
- F-statistic is calculated as \( F = \frac{\text{MSR}}{\text{MSE}} \) where:
  - MSR (Mean Square Regression) = \( \frac{\text{SSR}}{k} \)
  - MSE (Mean Square Error) = \( \frac{\text{SSE}}{n-k-1} \)
- Under \( H_0 \), the F-statistic follows an F-distribution with \( df1 = k \) and \( df2 = n-k-1 \).

#### (iv) Hypotheses for the F-test
- \( H_0 \): All \( \beta \) coefficients are zero (no effect).
- \( H_1 \): At least one \( \beta \) is not zero (effect present).

#### (v) P-value Conclusion
- A p-value of 0.001229 indicates significant evidence to reject \( H_0 \), suggesting that factors significantly affect the number of fawns.

#### (vi) Prediction for Specific Conditions
Using the regression model:
\[ \text{Fawns} = -5.92201 + 0.33822 \times 900 + 0.40150 \times 350 + 0.26295 \times 5 \]
The predicted number of fawns for the conditions given is approximately \( 440.32 \).
