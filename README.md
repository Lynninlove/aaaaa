Certainly! Below is a template for a README file for your Spring Boot project that handles CSV data for cell phones. This template assumes you have already set up your project repository and includes sections that explain how to set up the project, run it, and details about the API endpoints.

# Cell Phone Data Management System

This project is a Spring Boot application designed to ingest, process, and store data from a CSV file containing cell phone specifications. The application allows users to upload a CSV file, parses the content, and stores it in a database for easy retrieval and management.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up your project locally. To get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- Java JDK 11 or newer
- Maven (if not included in your IDE)
- An IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://yourrepositoryurl.com
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

2. **Open the project in your IDE:**

   Ensure that your IDE recognizes it as a Maven project and downloads all the necessary dependencies automatically.

3. **Configure the application:**

   Modify the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to adjust the database and other configurations as necessary. For development, you can use an in-memory database like H2.

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
   spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
   spring.datasource.username=sa
   spring.datasource.password=password
   spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect

   # H2 Console
   spring.h2.console.enabled=true
   spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
   ```

4. **Build the project:**

   Run the following command in the root directory of the project:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

5. **Run the application:**

   Execute the Spring Boot run command:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   Alternatively, you can run the application directly from your IDE.

### Using the Application

#### Uploading a CSV File

To upload a CSV file and store the cell phone data:

1. **Start your Spring Boot application.**
2. **Use a REST client like Postman to make a POST request:**

   - URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/cells/upload`
   - Method: POST
   - Body: form-data
   - Key: `file`
   - Value: [Select your CSV file]

   This endpoint will parse and store the cell phone data from the CSV file into the database.

#### Retrieving All Cell Phone Records

- **URL**: `http://localhost:8080/api/cells`
- **Method**: GET

This endpoint retrieves all cell phone records stored in the database.

## API Reference

### Endpoints

- **POST `/api/cells/upload`** - Uploads a CSV file and stores its data.
- **GET `/api/cells`** - Retrieves all stored cell phone records.
